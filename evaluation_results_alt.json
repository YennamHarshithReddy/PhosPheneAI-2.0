        "In a blog post last month, Stephen Almond, the ICO\u2019s executive director of regulatory risk, offered some tips and a little warning for developers of generative AI when it comes to compliance with U.K. data protection rules. \u201cOrganisations developing or using generative AI should be considering their data protection obligations from the outset, taking a data protection by design and by default approach,\u201d he suggested. \u201cThis isn\u2019t optional \u2014 if you\u2019re processing personal data, it\u2019s the law.\u201d\n\nOver the English Channel in the European Union, meanwhile, lawmakers are in the process of deciding a fixed set of rules that are likely to apply to generative AI.\n\nNegotiations toward a final text for the EU\u2019s incoming AI rulebook are ongoing \u2014 but currently there\u2019s a focus on how to regulate foundational models via amendments to the risk-based framework for regulating uses of AI the bloc published in draft over two years ago.\n\nIt remains to be seen where the EU\u2019s co-legislators will end up on what\u2019s sometimes also referred to as general purpose AI.

Me.\u201d\n\nOf course, that scene didn\u2019t appear on HBO\u2019s hit show, but it\u2019s a good illustration of generative AI\u2019s level of sophistication compared to the real thing. Yet as the Writers Guild of America goes on strike in pursuit of livable working conditions and better streaming residuals, the networks won\u2019t budge on writers\u2019 demands to regulate the use of AI in writers\u2019 rooms.\n\n\u201cOur proposal is that we not be required to adapt something that\u2019s output by AI, and that the output of an AI not be considered writers\u2019 work,\u201d comedy writer Adam Conover told TechCrunch. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t entirely exclude that technology from the production process, but it does mean that our working conditions wouldn\u2019t be undermined by AI.\u201d\n\nBut the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) refused to engage with that proposal, instead offering a yearly meeting to discuss \u201cadvances in technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we first put [the proposal] in, we thought we were covering our bases \u2014 you know, some of our members are worried about this, the area is moving quickly, we should get ahead of it,\u201d Conover said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be a contentious issue because the fact of the matter is, the current state of the text-generation technology is completely incapable of writing any work that could be used in a production.\u201d",
        "The legal spats between artists and the companies training AI on their artwork show no sign of abating.\n\nWithin the span of a few months, several lawsuits have emerged over generative AI tech from companies including OpenAI and Stability AI, brought by plaintiffs who allege that copyrighted data \u2014 mostly art \u2014 was used without their permission to train the generative models. Generative AI models \u201clearn\u201d to create art, code and more by \u201ctraining\u201d on sample images and text, usually scraped indiscriminately from the web.\n\nIn an effort to grant artists more control over how \u2014 and where \u2014 their art\u2019s used, Jordan Meyer and Mathew Dryhurst co-founded the startup Spawning AI. Spawning created HaveIBeenTrained, a website that allows creators to opt out of the training dataset for one art-generating AI model, Stable Diffusion v3, due to be released in the coming months.\n\nAs of March, artists had used HaveIBeenTrained to remove 80 million pieces of artwork from the Stable Diffusion training set. By late April, that figure had eclipsed 1 billion.\n\nAs the demand for Spawning\u2019s service grew, the company \u2014 which was entirely bootstrapped up until that point \u2014 sought an outside investment.

        "In a blog post last month, Stephen Almond, the ICO\u2019s executive director of regulatory risk, offered some tips and a little warning for developers of generative AI when it comes to compliance with U.K. data protection rules. \u201cOrganisations developing or using generative AI should be considering their data protection obligations from the outset, taking a data protection by design and by default approach,\u201d he suggested. \u201cThis isn\u2019t optional \u2014 if you\u2019re processing personal data, it\u2019s the law.\u201d\n\nOver the English Channel in the European Union, meanwhile, lawmakers are in the process of deciding a fixed set of rules that are likely to apply to generative AI.\n\nNegotiations toward a final text for the EU\u2019s incoming AI rulebook are ongoing \u2014 but currently there\u2019s a focus on how to regulate foundational models via amendments to the risk-based framework for regulating uses of AI the bloc published in draft over two years ago.\n\nIt remains to be seen where the EU\u2019s co-legislators will end up on what\u2019s sometimes also referred to as general purpose AI. But, as we reported recently, parliamentarians are pushing for a layered approach to tackle safety issues with foundational models; the complexity of responsibilities across AI supply chains; and to address specific content concerns (like copyright) which are associated with generative AI.",
        "Comedian Yedoye Travis sees how AI could be useful in a writers\u2019 room.\n\n\u201cWhat we do in writers\u2019 rooms is ultimately bouncing ideas around,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cEven if it\u2019s not good per se, an AI can throw together a script in however many minutes, compared to a week for human writers, and then it\u2019s easier to edit than to write.\u201d\n\nBut even if there may be some promise for how humans can leverage this technology, he worries that studios see it merely as a way to demand more from writers over a shorter period of time.\n\n\u201cIt says to me that they\u2019re only concerned with things being made,\u201d Travis said. \u201cThey\u2019re not concerned with people being paid for things being made.\u201d\n\nWriters are also advocating to regulate the use of AI in entertainment because it remains a legal grey area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear that the work that it outputs is copyrightable, and a movie studio is not going to spend $50 to $100 million shooting a script that they don\u2019t know that they own the copyright to,\u201d Conover said. \u201cSo we figured this would be an easy give for [the AMPTP], but they completely stonewalled on it.\u201d",

So we can speculate that providers of powerful foundational AI models may, down the line, be judged to have SMS \u2014 meaning they could expect to face bespoke rules on how they must operate vis-a-vis rivals and consumers in the U.K. market.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s data protection watchdog, the ICO, also has its eye on generative AI.

        "You gave a talk recently about, I don\u2019t want to say the dangers of the large language models, but\u2026\n\nWell, I did say there are hazards there. I was talking to a bunch of investment bankers, or VCs, and I said, you know, don\u2019t try to sell stuff to your investors just because it\u2019s flashy and shiny. Be cautious about going too fast and trying to apply it without figuring out how to put guardrails in place.\n\nI raised a question of hazard and wanting people to be more thoughtful about which applications made sense. I even suggested an analogy: you know how the Society of Automotive Engineers, they have different risk levels for the self driving cars \u2014 a risk level idea could apply to artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nFor entertainment purposes, perhaps it\u2019s not too concerning, unless it goes down some dark path, in which case, you might want to put some friction into the system to deal with that, especially a younger user. But then, as you get to the point where you\u2019re training these things to do medical diagnosis or make investment advice, or make decisions about whether somebody gets out of jail\u2026 now suddenly, the risk factors are extremely high.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be unaware of those risk factors. We can, as we build applications, be prepared to detect excursions away from safe territory, so that we don\u2019t accidentally inflict some harm by the use of these kinds of technologies.\n\nSo we need some kind of guardrails.",
