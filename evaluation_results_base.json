        "An AI white paper published in March signalled ministers\u2019 preference to avoid setting any bespoke rules (or oversight bodies) to govern uses of artificial intelligence at this stage. However ministers said existing U.K. regulators \u2014 including the CMA, which was directly name-checked \u2014 would be expected to issue guidance to encourage safe, fair and accountable uses of AI.\n\nThe CMA says its initial review of foundational AI models is in line with instructions in the white paper, where the government talked about existing regulators conducting \u201cdetailed risk analysis\u201d in order to be in a position to carry out potential enforcements, i.e. on dangerous, unfair and unaccountable applications of AI, using their existing powers.",
        "\u201cFoundation models, which include large language models and generative artificial intelligence (AI), that have emerged over the past five years, have the potential to transform much of what people and businesses do. To ensure that innovation in AI continues in a way that benefits consumers, businesses and the UK economy, the government has asked regulators, including the [CMA], to think about how the innovative development and deployment of AI can be supported against five overarching principles: safety, security and robustness; appropriate transparency and explainability; fairness; accountability and governance; and contestability and redress,\u201d the CMA wrote in a press release.\u201d",
        "Over the English Channel in the European Union, meanwhile, lawmakers are in the process of deciding a fixed set of rules that are likely to apply to generative AI.\n\nNegotiations toward a final text for the EU\u2019s incoming AI rulebook are ongoing \u2014 but currently there\u2019s a focus on how to regulate foundational models via amendments to the risk-based framework for regulating uses of AI the bloc published in draft over two years ago.",
        "Stanford University\u2019s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Center\u2019s Center for Research on Foundation Models is credited with coining the term \u201cfoundational models\u201d, back in 2021, to refer to AI systems that focus on training one model on a huge amount of data and adapting it to many applications.\n\n\u201cThe development of AI touches upon a number of important issues, including safety, security, copyright, privacy, and human rights, as well as the ways markets work. Many of these issues are being considered by government or other regulators, so this initial review will focus on the questions the CMA is best placed to address \u2014 what are the likely implications of the development of AI foundation models for competition and consumer protection?\u201d the CMA added.",
        "It remains to be seen where the EU\u2019s co-legislators will end up on what\u2019s sometimes also referred to as general purpose AI. But, as we reported recently, parliamentarians are pushing for a layered approach to tackle safety issues with foundational models; the complexity of responsibilities across AI supply chains; and to address specific content concerns (like copyright) which are associated with generative AI.\n\nAdd to that, EU data protection law already applies to AI, of course. And privacy-focused investigations of models like ChatGPT are underway in the bloc \u2014 including in Italy where an intervention by the local watchdog led to OpenAI rushing out a series of privacy disclosures and controls last month."
